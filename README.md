# To-Do-List-using-Bootstrap
A simple To-Do List Website UI built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Features a clean layout and structured design for task organization. Currently not responsive, so it may not adapt to smaller screens. Planned updates include adding responsiveness and interactivity using JavaScript. Contributions are welcome!
